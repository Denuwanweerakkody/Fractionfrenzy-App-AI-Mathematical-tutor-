#--Fractionfrenzy
Fraction mathematical ITS for students/ OWL Ontology
The project concluded in a relevant prototype of an intelligent tutoring system for fraction learning but also brought into sharp view various learnings related to user centric design, backend to frontend integration and ontologies as a way to achieve dynamism in content. This system works effectively in relation to its intended purposes, however some changes to improve scalability, adaptability and user interaction might turn it into an even stronger and complete learning system.
